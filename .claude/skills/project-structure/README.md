# 🗂️ Project Structure

Canonical, **non-negotiable** architecture for the **festiVAL** Angular application. The project uses a **feature-sliced** structure with **enforced module boundaries** — the professional standard for Angular apps that need to scale past a handful of routes.

## Purpose

Guarantee that the project layout remains identical across every feature, contributor, and AI-assisted change. The structure optimizes for four things, in order:

1. **Lazy-loading by default** — every feature is a self-contained chunk; nothing leaks into the initial bundle.
2. **Cognitive locality** — everything a feature needs lives in one folder.
3. **Safe deletion** — removing a feature is `rm -rf` plus one route line.
4. **Enforced boundaries** — ESLint stops the architecture from rotting over time.

This skill is **MANDATORY**. Consult it before creating, moving, or renaming any file. The structure is a contract; deviations are documented here or they do not happen.

## Mental model: three layers

```
core / layout   →   reusable, app-wide, loaded eagerly
features/*      →   vertical slices, loaded lazily, isolated from each other
shared/*        →   horizontal toolbox, imported by features, never imports them
```

The dependency rule is one-directional and absolute:

```
features  →  shared  →  (nothing)
   │            ▲
   └──→ core ───┘
features  →  core
layout    →  shared, core
```

- A **feature never imports another feature**.
- **shared never imports a feature or layout**.
- **core never imports a feature, layout, or shared/ui** (core is the lowest layer).

### Anatomy of a feature

Every feature has the same four parts. This shape is **fixed**:

| Part               | Contains                                                        | Rules                                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feature/`         | The smart page component bound to the route.                   | Injects stores/services, orchestrates `ui/`. One page per folder. |
| `ui/`              | Dumb presentational components local to this feature.          | No HTTP, no store injection. Data in via `input()`, events via `output()`. |
| `data-access/`     | Stores (Signals/SignalStore), services, resolvers, schemas.    | The only place this feature talks to the network or holds state.  |
| `<feature>.routes.ts` | The lazy route config.                                      | **The feature's only public export.** Nothing else is imported from outside. |

A feature is loaded exactly once, lazily, from `app.routes.ts`:

```ts
// app.routes.ts
export const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: ShellComponent,        // from @layout/shell
    children: [
      { path: '', loadChildren: () => import('@features/home/home.routes').then(m => m.HOME_ROUTES) },
      { path: 'festivales', loadChildren: () => import('@features/festival-list/festival-list.routes').then(m => m.FESTIVAL_LIST_ROUTES) },
      { path: 'festivales/:slug', loadChildren: () => import('@features/festival-detail/festival-detail.routes').then(m => m.FESTIVAL_DETAIL_ROUTES) },
      { path: 'artistas/:slug', loadChildren: () => import('@features/artist-detail/artist-detail.routes').then(m => m.ARTIST_DETAIL_ROUTES) },
      { path: 'buscar', loadChildren: () => import('@features/search/search.routes').then(m => m.SEARCH_ROUTES) },
      { path: 'sobre-nosotros', loadChildren: () => import('@features/about/about.routes').then(m => m.ABOUT_ROUTES) },
    ],
  },
];
```

### Per-component folder

Every component — in `features/*/ui/`, `features/*/feature/`, `layout/`, or `shared/ui/` — has **exactly** this shape (Angular 21 convention, no `.component` suffix):

```
<name>/
├── <name>.ts
├── <name>.html
├── <name>.scss
└── <name>.spec.ts
```

Route-bound pages use the `.page` suffix on the class file: `home.page.ts`. No `index.ts` barrel files anywhere — they defeat tree-shaking and obscure the import graph.

---

## Global styles

```
src/styles/
├── _tokens.scss               # primitive tokens (raw palette)
├── _semantic.scss             # semantic tokens (--bg-canvas, --text-primary, --accent-violet)
├── _typography.scss           # font families, type ramp, line-heights, tracking
├── _spacing.scss              # 4 px base scale
├── _radii.scss                # border radii
├── _shadows.scss              # elevation system (optional partial)
├── _motion.scss               # easing curves, durations, prefers-reduced-motion
├── _breakpoints.scss          # sm 640, md 768, lg 1024, xl 1280
├── _mixins.scss               # glass, focus-ring, container, truncate, line-clamp
├── _animations.scss           # keyframes (fade-up, pulse-soft, live-dot)
└── _reset.scss                # opinionated reset
```

The root `src/styles.scss` is the only file that `@use`s these partials. Component SCSS imports tokens via `@use 'styles/mixins' as *;` (resolved through `stylePreprocessorOptions.includePaths: ["src"]` in `angular.json`). See [[theming-styling]].

---

## Path aliases

Configured in `tsconfig.json`. **Imports must always use an alias** — never a relative path that climbs out of the current folder.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@core/*":               ["src/app/core/*"],
      "@layout/*":             ["src/app/layout/*"],
      "@features/*":           ["src/app/features/*"],
      "@shared/ui/*":          ["src/app/shared/ui/*"],
      "@shared/data-access/*": ["src/app/shared/data-access/*"],
      "@shared/domain/*":      ["src/app/shared/domain/*"],
      "@shared/util/*":        ["src/app/shared/util/*"],
      "@shared/pipes/*":       ["src/app/shared/pipes/*"],
      "@shared/directives/*":  ["src/app/shared/directives/*"],
      "@shared/testing/*":     ["src/app/shared/testing/*"],
      "@env/*":                ["src/environments/*"],
      "@styles/*":             ["src/styles/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

Inside a single feature, relative imports (`./ui/festival-hero/...`) are fine — they never climb above the feature root. Crossing any layer boundary requires an alias.

---

## Naming rules

- **Folders**: kebab-case (`festival-card`, `festival-list`).
- **Page classes**: `<feature>.page.ts` → `HomePageComponent`, `FestivalListPageComponent`.
- **Components**: `<name>.ts` → `FestivalCardComponent`. Selector prefix `fv-` (e.g. `fv-festival-card`).
- **Services**: `<name>.service.ts` → `FestivalService`.
- **Stores**: `<name>.store.ts` → `FestivalsStore` (PascalCase, `Store` suffix).
- **Models + schemas**: `<name>.model.ts` → exports both the Zod schema (`FestivalSchema`) and the inferred type (`Festival`).
- **Guards / resolvers**: `<name>.guard.ts` / `<name>.resolver.ts`, functional.
- **Route files**: `<feature>.routes.ts`, exporting `UPPER_SNAKE_ROUTES`.
- **SCSS partials**: leading underscore (`_tokens.scss`).
- **Festival slugs**: kebab-case, lowercase, ASCII (`fib-benicassim`). Immutable once published.
- **i18n keys**: dotted path, lowercase (`festival.detail.lineup.title`).

---

## Placement decision tree

When creating a new file, ask in order — stop at the first **yes**:

1. Is it a global singleton, interceptor, error handler, initializer, or SSR/platform helper? → `core/<subfolder>/`.
2. Is it part of the app shell (nav, footer, outlet host)? → `layout/`.
3. Does it belong to exactly **one** feature?
   - The route-bound page? → `features/<feature>/feature/`.
   - A presentational component? → `features/<feature>/ui/<name>/`.
   - A store, service, resolver, or schema? → `features/<feature>/data-access/`.
4. Is it reused by **two or more** features?
   - A presentational component? → `shared/ui/<name>/`.
   - A service or store? → `shared/data-access/`.
   - A model/schema? → `shared/domain/`.
   - A pipe / directive? → `shared/pipes/` or `shared/directives/`.
   - A pure helper? → `shared/util/`.
5. None of the above? → **Stop and discuss.** Do not invent a new top-level folder.

**The "three uses" rule does not apply to `shared/` promotion — the threshold is two.** A component used by a single feature stays in that feature. The moment a second feature needs it, it moves to `shared/ui/`. Anticipatory placement in `shared/` is forbidden: do not put something in `shared/` because you *think* another feature will use it.

---

## Hard rules (NEVER violate)

1. **A feature never imports from another feature.** Shared code goes to `shared/`.
2. **`shared/` never imports from `features/` or `layout/`.**
3. **`core/` never imports from `features/`, `layout/`, or `shared/ui/`.**
4. Inside a feature, **`ui/` never imports from `data-access/`.** Presentational components receive data via inputs.
5. **A feature's only public surface is its `<feature>.routes.ts`.** Never deep-import `features/x/ui/...` or `features/x/data-access/...` from outside the feature.
6. **No NgModules.** Every component, directive, and pipe is standalone.
7. **No `index.ts` barrel files.**
8. **No HTTP calls outside a `data-access/` folder** (feature-local or `shared/data-access/`).
9. **No state mutations outside a store.**
10. **No relative import that climbs above a feature root.** Use a path alias instead.
11. **No new top-level folder under `src/app/`** without updating this document.
12. **No hardcoded strings, colors, or spacing** in components — i18n keys and design tokens only.

Rules 1–5 and 10 are enforced automatically — see below.

---

## Enforcing boundaries (ESLint)

Boundaries are not honor-system. They are enforced with **`eslint-plugin-boundaries`** (configured when tooling lands). Element types map to folders:

```jsonc
// .eslintrc — boundaries config (sketch)
{
  "settings": {
    "boundaries/elements": [
      { "type": "core",    "pattern": "src/app/core/*" },
      { "type": "layout",  "pattern": "src/app/layout/*" },
      { "type": "feature", "pattern": "src/app/features/*", "capture": ["name"] },
      { "type": "shared",  "pattern": "src/app/shared/*" }
    ]
  },
  "rules": {
    "boundaries/element-types": ["error", {
      "default": "disallow",
      "rules": [
        { "from": "feature", "allow": ["shared", "core", ["feature", { "name": "${from.name}" }]] },
        { "from": "layout",  "allow": ["shared", "core"] },
        { "from": "shared",  "allow": ["shared", "core"] },
        { "from": "core",    "allow": ["core"] }
      ]
    }],
    "boundaries/entry-point": ["error", {
      "default": "disallow",
      "rules": [
        { "target": ["feature"], "allow": "*.routes.ts" }
      ]
    }]
  }
}
```

A violating import fails `npm run lint`, which fails the pre-commit gate (see [[testing-patterns]]). This is how the structure stays optimal years from now.

---

## Why this structure is optimal

- **Maximal code-splitting** — each feature (UI + store + services) is one lazy chunk. The initial bundle carries only `core` + `layout` + the landing feature.
- **Deletion is trivial** — `rm -rf features/x/` plus removing one line in `app.routes.ts` removes a feature cleanly, with zero orphaned files elsewhere.
- **Ownership is obvious** — a person or agent owns `features/x/` end to end.
- **Tests run faster** — `vitest --changed` re-runs only the touched feature's specs (see [[testing-patterns]]).
- **SSR is per-feature** — the pre-render decision lives in each `<feature>.routes.ts`, not in one global list.
- **Refactors are local** — changing how `festival-detail` fetches data touches only `features/festival-detail/data-access/`.
- **The boundary lint makes it self-healing** — accidental coupling fails CI instead of silently accumulating.

---

## When the structure must evolve

A new feature is just a new `features/<name>/` folder with the four standard parts — that is **not** an evolution, it is normal use.

A genuine structural change (a new top-level layer, a new `core/` subfolder) requires:

1. Propose it in the PR description.
2. Add it to this document with its purpose and a placement rule.
3. Update the decision tree and hard rules above.
4. Update the path aliases in `tsconfig.json` and the boundaries config.
5. Update `CLAUDE.md` so all agents see the new convention.

**No silent additions.** The structure is a contract.
